        <h1>Cyrus GIBLAIN</h1>
        <p>I am an ESSEC Business school Bachelor of Business Administration student in
        Singapore aiming to pursue a career in finance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="finance-card card-white">
        <h2>Passion for Finance</h2>
        <p>I am very interested in Finance and Accounting, and I am enthusiastic and
        motivated to deepen my understanding of these subjects in a corporate environment.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="geopolitics card-white">
        <h2>Geopolitics</h2>
        <p> I am very eager to understand the financial
        and economic aspects of a business along with the links between economy and geopolitics. Indeed,
        economy is a key area to understand global dynamics, such as the energy resource issues. I am very
        interested in the importance of gas for the global economy. Inarguably, its use for electric production
        makes it inestimable. War in Ukraine shows that geopolitics can have noteworthy implications on businesses. 
        Understanding business management principles such as risk management is hence key in case of such black swan
        events.</p>

    <div class="tennis card-white">
        <h2>I love ðŸŽ¾</h2>
        <p>I have been playing tennis for a long time. My perfectionist nature and competitive spirit drive me to constantly seek ways to improve. Tennis is a sport that encourages self-improvement, with a significant mental aspect. I also enjoy playing with my friends, as it adds a fun and social dimension to the game.

    <div class="languages card-white">
        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>Languages are particularly important to me as they are the gateway to new cultures, exchanges, and
        growth. I enjoy decrypting the etymology of words and discovering our Indo-European legacy. I was
        selected for a highly competitive middle school program in Mandarin. I studied both Spanish and
        Mandarin at an honorâ€™s level for four years in addition to my core high school curriculum.
        Last year, I could hone my English skills thanks to an immersion of several months in Scotland. I
        obtained 7.5 at the IELTS.
        Itâ€™s truly enriching to live an international experience here in Singapore, I am fortunate to interact with
        people from all around the world.</p>

    <div class="travelling card-white">
        <h2>Discovering the world</h2>
